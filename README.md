- [Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/docs/install/)

### How to start local development
- Start docker
- Start Minikube
```sh
minikube start
```

## TODO
- Host swagger docs to some url

# Booking Holds TTL
Deletes expired rows from booking_holds (and their booking_hold_items via ON DELETE CASCADE) on a schedule so that previously held slots become visible/available again.

This tool runs as a short-lived job with Kubernetes CronJob. It performs one sweep and exits with a success/failure code.

## Why it exists
- GET /professional endpoints hide a slot if thereâ€™s a non-expired hold.
- When a client abandons payment or a flow fails, the hold expires.
- To prevent an expired hold from blocking a slot, we periodically purge expired holds.
- Purging only the parent booking_holds ensures items disappear automatically.
